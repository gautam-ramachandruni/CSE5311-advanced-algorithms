# Randomized Search Trees
The goal of this project is to review binary search trees and implement randomized search trees (treaps).

This C++ program uses a treap to implement the sweepline algorithm for 2-d closest pairs in expected O(n log n) time. The input to the program is a single line with the number of points (n) followed by the n points as pairs of integer coordinates, one pair per line. Besides outputting the coordinates of the two closest points, the program provides performance metrics such as: maximum BST size, CPU time, and the number of rotations.
