# Merging and Subset Sums
This project intends to review "merging" and understand subset sums, an NP-complete problem.

Provided are two versions of a C program that implements:

1. O(2^n) merging approach for solving exact subset sums

2. a faster version that runs in O(2^n/2) time

The input to the program is a single line with the number of points (n) and a target value followed by n positive integers, one per line. Likewise, the output from the codes will be a subset or an indication that it does not exist. In addition, each code indicates its time and space usage.
